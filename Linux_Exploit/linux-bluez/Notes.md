According to the Armis researches:
> All Linux devices running BlueZ are affected by the information leak vulnerability (CVE-2017-1000250).

> All Linux devices from version 2.6.32 (released in July 2009) until version 4.14 are affected by the remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-1000251)

So I installed a 16.04.03 Ubuntu and I downgraded the Linux Kernel to version 4.13 following this [guide](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2017/09/install-linux-kernel-4-13-ubuntu-16-04-higher/)
